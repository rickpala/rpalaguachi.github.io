### New year, new me.
The new year is coming upon us. I wanted a calendar that can help me keep track of my year-long goals.
So I created a minimal calendar template for 2023, inspired by [Matt D'Avella's 2-Day Rule.][TwoDayRule]

I created this template to abstract away from the monthly view that we're used to on regular calendar. Instead, this
calendar takes a broader view on the entire year. It distinguishes the months using subtle colors,
and also tallies the weeks on the right hand side. Numbered days are intentionally omitted.

All you have to do is X, color in, or cross-off a box every time you perform your desired habit. If your
resolution is to exercise more, cross off every day you go to the gym. You'll build a streak, and in
doing so, motivate yourself further to continue achieving your goals and prolonging the streak.

Here is an example from a prior year. I was most active on Mondays and Tuesdays.

I plan on hanging it up on my wall next to my mirror. Every day that I code at least 1 line, I'll
cross off a day in sharpie. No fancy apps or expensive purchases required.
