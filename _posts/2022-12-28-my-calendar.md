title: My minimalistic yearly calendar template for 2023
---

The new year is upon us, and I created a free printable calendar template for 2023.

I created this template to abstract away from the monthly view that's standard. Instead,
this calendar takes a broader view on the entire year. It subtly distinguishes the months using
color, while also tallying the weeks on the right hand side. Numbered days are intentionally
omitted.

I plan on using it as just a progress bar of the year, and hanging it up on my wall. Every day that
passes, you can just cross it off in sharpie. It's nothing fancy.
