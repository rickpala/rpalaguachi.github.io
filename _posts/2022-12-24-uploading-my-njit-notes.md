title: Open-sourcing my NJIT study guides.
---

Check them out [here](note).

# Why?
During my 4 years of undergrad, I took over 40 classes mostly within Computer Science and
Mathematics. In an effort to retain this information for my future self, I am going to publicly
upload all my notes for free (while being mindful as to not violating academic integrity policies
and thus nullifying the degree I worked hard for).


As a part of my study process, I would create review guides about a week prior to an exam. Let's say
I was taking a course on Complex Analysis and a midterm was 10 days away. My process would look
like this:

1. Go to the syllabus and find a list of the covered chapters/subjects/topics.
2. Collect all the homework assignments that will be covered on said exam.
3. Create a new guide, outlined by Chapters first, then Sections.
4. **Manually** collect the information section-by-section and compose the most important bits into
   my study guide.

# The subjects I plan to include
Up until I got an iPad Pro during my second year of university, I took all my notes by hand. With
time, I will remaster them to a digital format (probably using some OCR).
