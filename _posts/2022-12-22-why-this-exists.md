Herein lies the digital portfolio of Ricky Palaguachi. Many different projects may live here at any given time.
I interested in technology of all kinds, but most importantly:
* **Programming languages.** Python is 'home' for me, but I've traveled to JavaScript, Java, and C++. I'm currently learning Swift.
* **Productivity Software.** My life is organized digitally on Todoist, Notion, and Apple Calendar. This website is an extension thereof.
* **Consumer technology.** I am an avid Apple enthusiast. I even worked for Apple part-time throughout university.
* **Home Labs.** I revived a 2011 Mac Mini with a fresh Ubuntu installation. It's my digital playground for hacking at home.
* **Smart Homes.** Automation, for a simpler home life.

When I'm not sitting behind a computer, I'm usually trying a new caf√©, practicing martial arts, or learning something new.
Some of my personal interests include:
* **Mixed martial arts.** I started training Taekwondo at a young age, and am currently a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor.
* **Musica latina.** I only listen to spanish music, visit my Spotify profile for proof.
* **Health science.** Andrew Huberman is a big inspiration of mine, and I strongly believe he runs the best podcast in the world.
* **Minimalism.**
