title: Formal education was useless
---

### And there I was
As a junior software developer, I often have to dig through heaps of how-to guides and tutorials to
accomplish damn near anything. Sometimes, they're really challenging to read from as instruction
manuals. Other times, I want to write a personalized "thank you" message to the author because of
how well-written their post was.

I was reading [this Medium article][MediumNginxDocker] about configuring HTTPS for an Nginx server
within a Docker container. Reading this blog post actually taught me something, and I solved my
problem: setting up HTTP**S**. Again, I felt compelled to thank the author, but my mind began
pondering "What if **I** could write like this? What's stopping me?"

###  I had an epiphany.

After all, I just graduated and received my degree in Computer Science. I got good grades, I am
"smart" on paper, my professors admired me. I _should_ be able to write about technical stuff like
this, right? And that's when I realized:

> College only taught me to regurgitate information I've been told. Not come up with my own creative
> ideas and solutions.

And that feeling right there, of regurgitation, is what I've been conditioned to believe as "good"
because it scored high on exams. But if I can't come up with my own solutions, and I find comfort in
how-to guides, then that's what I was taught at university.

This feeling isn't only present in my software life. No, no. I'm always fact-checking or correcting
myself. To spit out the same thoughts and ideas that I've either Googled or heard from some "more
reputable" source (whatever that means). I find myself lacking originality and it's affecting my
brain. And I believe education failed me in this regard. It only taught me to spit back facts and
formulas, not how to innovate, design, and push creative boundaries.

That's why I created this website. To document my growth through these stream-of-consciousness-esque
thoughts, while expressing creativity through my trials and errors of software development, home
labbing, and other tech-related projects.

Merry Christmas.
