I'm Ricky Palaguachi. Programmer. Mathematician. Tech enthusiast. 

I graduated from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2022, with my Bachelors in Computer
Science and Applied Mathematics, _magna cum laude_.

When I'm not working at my day job as a software engineer, I'm typically studying a new technology,
working on this website, or practicing jiu-jitsu. When I find time in between, I'm usually out
listening to music, podcasts or (less frequently) reading a book. I also like to play video games.

# What are my **priorities** now

### My Physical Health
* Practicing jiu-jitsu 4+ times per week. I'm currently a white belt and have plans to continue
  competing.
* Running 10 miles per week. That's 20 marathons in a year.
* Eating healthy hispanic food, thanks to my family that feeds me.
* Stretch Goal: Participate in a 10K race (6.2 miles)
* Stretch Goal: Compete in 5+ jiu-jitsu tournaments.

### My Mental Health
* Listening to Andrew Huberman's podcast, and putting into practice his tools for an optimized life.
* Reading fiction and nonfiction books, to learn from others and lose myself in a good story.
* Decluttering and maintaining order in my digital and physical life. I'm a bit of a neat freak.
* Talking to more strangers, and learning from minds different than mine.


### My Technical Development
* Earning my TensorFlow certificate from Google
* Working on my home lab. Here I can practice being my own hardware, software, and network engineer.
* Stretch: Developing an app to publish on the Apple App Store

# What I'd like to add
I'm always considering new opportunities within the tech industry. I'm open-minded and intentionally
left my last statement vague.
